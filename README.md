# Jekyll + Foundation 6 Starter Site
This is a starter repository for Jekyll sites styled with Zurb Foundation 6. This repo includes a gulpfile with SASS sourcemaps, PHP support (for that occasional need), and serves everything up with Browsersync + live reloading.

I find I use this combination a lot, so I figured I might as well create a base version (which, once created, might as well be shared). Input welcome!

### To get started:

1. Clone repository 
  
    `$ git clone https://github.com/andybywire/jekyll-foundation.git <destination-directory>` 

2. Make sure you're in your project file and run NPM install
  
    `$ npm install`

3. Compile the base site and start the server with gulp
    
    `$ gulp`
