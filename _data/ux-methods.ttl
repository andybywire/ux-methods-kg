Project Goals
- Create a useful, dynamic, and trustworthy resource for UX techniques, processes, and resources
- Bring together data from multiple sources and present it holistically through a single, unified interface layer
- Allow the class structure (and resulting top level categories) to evolve based on content, connections, and evolving knowledge and practices in the broad field of user experience design
- Create a foundation upon which can be built affordances for soliciting and managing input from the wider design community"""@en ;

Web Resources are named with a code-based scheme due to the high variability of resource types and related metadata. The scheme currently used is AYYMMDD, where \"A\" is the first letter of the author last name (if known), or the first letter of publication name, and YYMMDD is the year, month, and date of publication, if known. If the date is not known, resources should be assigned a unique incremental number, starting with 000001.""" .
