# UXM (all data) returns inferred Top Goals & Methods, but no Disciplines. Class templates break the build. Goal: get this configuration to work.
# UXM_no_reasoner (all data) returns disciplines & methods, but no Top Goals. Class templates work.
# UXM_Inferred returns all an resources with functioning templates, but is not using inference on the server, which means it requires pre-inferencing in Protege.

    # Something is causing Jekyll to choke on class_template_mappings. May be an infinite loop somewhere? Works with a "pre-reasoned" export, but not Fuseki reasoning. Try cleaning up and fine tuning ontology and data and trying these out again. Perhaps also try different reasoners?
