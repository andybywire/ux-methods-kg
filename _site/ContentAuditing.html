    <h1>Content Auditing Method</h1>

<p>A content audit is a listing and analysis of all the content on an existing website (including pages, files, videos, audio or other data) that your users might reasonably encounter. Content audits identify content that needs to be revised in new versions of a website. Content audits can also help you identify who is responsible for content, how often it should be updated, and what role a particular piece of content plays for users.</p>



<ol>

<li>1. Identify a specific user need or user question that you’d like to address.</li>

<li></li>

<li>2. Create an inventory of content on your website. Navigate through the site from the home page and note the following about every piece of content: </li>

<li></li>

<li>- Title used in the site’s navigation for that page</li>

<li>- Title displayed on the page or item itself</li>

<li>- URL</li>

<li>- Parent page</li>

<li></li>

<li>3. Identify the main entry points for the user need you’re addressing. This could be external marketing, the homepage, a microsite, or another page.</li>

<li></li>

<li>4. From each entry point, trace the pages and tasks a user moves through until they address their need.</li>

<li></li>

<li>5. For every piece of content they might come across on that task flow, note:</li>

<li></li>

<li>- Author(s): who wrote or created the page</li>

<li>- Content owner(s): who ensures its credibility</li>

<li>- How often or when it was last updated</li>

<li>- Comments: qualitative assessment of what to change to better address your identified user need</li>

</ol>
