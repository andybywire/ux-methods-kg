    <h1>Card Sorting Method</h1>

<p>Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups. To conduct a card sort, you can use actual cards, pieces of paper, or one of several online card-sorting software tools.</p>



<ol>

<li>1. Give users a collection of content represented on cards.</li>

<li>2. Ask users to separate the cards into whatever categories make sense to them.</li>

<li>3. Ask users to label those categories.</li>

<li>4. Ask users to tell you why they grouped the cards and labeled the categories as they did.</li>
