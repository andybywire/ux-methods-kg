    <h1>Heuristic Evaluation Method</h1>

<p>In a heuristic evaluation, usability experts review your site’s interface and compare it against accepted usability principles. The analysis results in a list of potential usability issues.</p>



<ol>

<li>Recruit a group of three to five people familiar with evaluation methods. These people are not necessarily designers, but are familiar with common usability best practices. They are usually not users.</li>

<li>Ask each person to individually create a list of “heuristics” or general usability best practices. </li>

<li>Ask each person to evaluate the website against their list and write down possible problems.</li>

<li>After individual evaluations, gather people to discuss what they found and prioritize potential problems.</li>
